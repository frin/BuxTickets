This plugin is a heavy rewrite based on https://github.com/Xemnas33/PetitionPlugin that was made by FloydATC and modified by Xemnas33.

This is a complete rewrite. It uses MySQL database to store tickets, has added feature of groups, warping to comments (not just tickets) and supports the new player UUIDs.

Because the original plugin has no license, I am not providing one here, otherwise do with it as you wish (consider it as under MIT license).
